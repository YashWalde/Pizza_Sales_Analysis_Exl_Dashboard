## Process
- Imported four datasets â€“ Orders, Order Details, Pizzas, and Pizza Types into Excel.
- Performed data cleaning and transformation (removing duplicates, formatting columns, ensuring consistency).
- Loaded the cleaned data and built PivotTables to summarize key metrics like sales, orders, and categories.
- Created Pivot Charts (bar, pie, and donut charts) to visualize trends and distributions.
- Designed an interactive dashboard with slicers and KPI cards for dynamic filtering and quick insights.

## Project Insights 
- Classic pizzas contribute the highest sales share (~27%), followed closely by Supreme pizzas (~25%).
- The Classic Deluxe is the most popular pizza, ranking #1 in total orders.
- Large (L) and Medium (M) sizes dominate sales compared to other sizes.
- Monthly sales show clear fluctuations, helping identify peak demand periods.
- The bottom 5 pizzas indicate underperforming products that may need promotion or removal.
- Sales trends by day reveal which days of the week drive maximum orders.
